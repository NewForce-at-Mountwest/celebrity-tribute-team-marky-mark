    <h2>Intro:</h2>
    <div class="markyIntro"></div>
    <p>Mark Wahlberg is one of America's most beloved entertainers. As the youngest of 9 children, he grew up on the rough-and-tumble streets of Boston, Massachusetts, and dropped out of high shool at the age of 16.  He was often in trouble with the law, and after a brief stint in prison for assault and attempted murder, he credits God and prayer with turning his life around.  His violent youth and turbulent past are in stark contrast to his current fame.</p>
    
    
    <p>He first graced the stage as a fashion model and a rapper, performing under the stage name of "Marky-Mark." His introduction to the stage was due, in part, to his older brother, Donnie, leading the way as a founding member of the 90's boy-band, New Kids on the Block.  Mark ventured into acting with a debut role in the 1994 comedy "Renaissance Man," but it wasn't until his starring role in the film "Boogie Nights (1997)," that he started receiving attention as an actor.        
    </p>
    <p>Mark has been nominated for numerous awards for his acting, and was given a star on the Hollywood walk of fame in 2010.</p>
